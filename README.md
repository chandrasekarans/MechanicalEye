# MechanicalEye
IP camera that monitors continous motion detection and alert the user with live video coverage

Eyespy™ is a proposed new idea that tracks continuous motion detection and allows the
user to view live video streaming at any time. The two-axis gimbal designed prototype can
cover an overall 180° wide-angle view both horizontal and vertical. The system is embedded
with adequate sensors to track the motion more precisely. The sensors are placed in a way
that an object can be tracked in all the quadrants – that enable the system to be a complete
surveillance mechanism with more accurate readings. Moreover, the eye embodied with the
camera can track the motion and provide live video streaming to the user.
