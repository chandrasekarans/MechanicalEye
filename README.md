# EyeSpy™
IP camera that monitors continous motion detection and alert the user with live video coverage

<h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
EyeSpy™ is a proposed new idea that tracks continuous motion detection and allows the user to view live video streaming at any time. The two-axis gimbal designed prototype can cover an overall 180° wide-angle view both horizontal and vertical. The system is embedded with adequate sensors to track the motion more precisely. The sensors are placed in a way that an object can be tracked in all the quadrants – that enable the system to be a complete surveillance mechanism with more accurate readings. Moreover, the eye embodied with the camera can track the motion and provide live video streaming to the user.

<h2>SCOPE</h2>
EyeSpy™ consists of four sensors, two each in horizontal and vertical direction having a coverage of 180-degree in both the axis. This design exhibits the following features:
* The eye shall continuously monitor any object by its movement and follows the object until the object is out of sight or idle.
* Whenever the object is out of sight or idle, the eye makes a move towards its home position.
* The camera attached to the centre of the eye captures the image of the object being monitored by the eye.
* The design allows the user to stream the video via wireless communication in any output terminal.
* A combined HMI with team 1 which enables the user to stream the videos from the cameras at the same time.

<h3>BENEFITS</h3>
EyeSpy is a security camera that can monitor the actions happening in a specific area. The design is a proposed new idea that can be used for both industrial and commercial
purposes.
1.  Continuous tracking system
The four sensors on each side continuously monitor the location and tracks an object when detected.
1.  Power efficient
The eye moves only when an action occurs else remains in an home position.
1.  Wireless and Real-time information
The Wi-Fi module attached to the camera allows the user to stream the video anywhere.
